        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“What’s past is prologue.” by <em>William Shakespeare</em></p></blockquote><p>I feel my life is falling now, not a heavy stone falling in a deep dark hole, but a wondering seed of dandelion floating in the air, slowly and quietly. Now, fortunately the spring is coming and the wind is rising me up. I cannot falling any more and I have to go further, I want to do it and I can do it.</p><p>I definitely knows what to do but I just did’t. These days I slept at 3 am and wake up at 12. What a shame! And what a pity!</p><p>Now I am going to sleep and when I wake up, I will see a new day and new life.</p>]]></content>
